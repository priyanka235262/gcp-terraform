TERRAFORM:Key Features of Terraform:-

Declarative Configuration: You define the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform takes care of the steps to achieve it.
Execution Plans: Before making changes, Terraform generates an execution plan, outlining the steps it will take, allowing you to review and approve the changes.
Provider Ecosystem: A wide range of providers are available for various cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), on-premises infrastructure, and other services, enabling you to manage diverse infrastructure.
Modularity: You can create reusable modules to encapsulate complex infrastructure configurations, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
State Management: Terraform maintains a state file, tracking the current state of your infrastructure. This state file is used to plan and apply changes efficiently.
How Terraform Works:

Write Configuration: Define your infrastructure in HCL files.
Initialize: Initialize the working directory to download necessary plugins.
Plan: Generate an execution plan, showing the changes Terraform will make.
Apply: Execute the plan to provision or modify infrastructure.
Benefits of Using Terraform:

Increased Efficiency: Automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
Improved Consistency: Ensure consistent infrastructure deployments.
Reduced Errors: Minimize human error through automation.
Version Control: Track changes to your infrastructure configurations.
Collaboration: Work collaboratively with teams on infrastructure projects.
By leveraging Terraform, you can streamline your infrastructure management processes, increase productivity, and improve the reliability of your deployments.

Common Structure:

Root Module:

main.tf: Contains the core configuration, defining the resources and their configurations.
variables.tf: Declares variables to make the configuration flexible and reusable.
outputs.tf: Defines outputs to export values from the infrastructure, such as IP addresses or resource IDs.
providers.tf: Specifies the providers for different cloud platforms or services.
version.tf: Defines the required versions of Terraform and providers.
Submodules:

Terraform allows you to create reusable modules for specific infrastructure components.
Submodules can be organized into their own directories, each containing its own main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, and providers.tf files.
Modules can be referenced in the root module or other submodules, promoting code reusability.
Example Structure:

my_infrastructure/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
├── versions.tf
├── modules/
│   ├── vpc/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   ├── outputs.tf
│   │   └── providers.tf
│   └── ec2/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── variables.tf
│       ├── outputs.tf
│       └── providers.tf

Initialization:

terraform init: Initializes a working directory, downloading necessary plugins.
Planning:

terraform plan: Generates an execution plan, showing the changes Terraform will make.
Applying:

terraform apply: Applies the planned changes to the infrastructure.
Destroying:

terraform destroy: Destroys the infrastructure defined in the configuration.
Other Useful Commands:

terraform fmt: Formats the configuration files to improve readability.
terraform validate: Validates the configuration syntax.
terraform output: Displays the values of outputs defined in the configuration.
terraform state list: Lists the resources managed by Terraform.
terraform state show <resource_address>: Shows the details of a specific resource.

Example Workflow:

Write Configuration: Create .tf files to define your infrastructure.
Initialize: Run terraform init to download necessary plugins.
